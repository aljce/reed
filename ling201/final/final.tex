The main instance of allomorphy in this data set is the morphemes for third
person plural objects. These are \{\ipa{ra}- \ipa{ja}- \ipa{jara}-\} with the first two
seemingly interchangeable. The last morpheme only appears in the data set when the
subject and object are both third person plural. In that case the information
that the subject is third person plural is reflected in the tense morpheme. This
could mean that it carries more information than the others but more data would
need to be provided to make a distinction. \\

This language nominative-accusative as the subject person morphemes are the same
when used in a transitive verb or used in an intransitive verb. While the object
person morphemes are different from the subject morphemes (\ipa{Na} vs
\ipa{na}).

This constituent structure only differs in the mother of the last preposition
phrase. This structure allows for a do so replacement of the last half of the
sentence. ``Darlene might do so'' is a grammatical sentence under Tree B but is not allowed
under Tree A. In a similar vain as before the last half of the sentence can be
pseudo clefted. ``What Darlene might do is get that new album by Beyonce on
Thursday'' and ``Get that new album by Beyonce on Thursday is what Darlene
might do'' are both grammatical sentences under Tree B but not possible under
Tree A. A response to the question ``What might Darlene do'' is ``get that new
album by Beyonce on Thursday''. If the last preposition is not in the verb
phrase you can't inclued the ``on Thursday'' part.

\section{Semantics}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \setcounter{enumii}{4}
      \item B entails and presupposes A because B meets the condition ($\ge1$
        Hungarian semanticist) for A to be true.
      \item A entails and presupposes B because B can be thought of as a pseudo
        projection of the two truth values in A.
      \item A does not entail B because there are contexts in which its true
        that not every student got the right answer while also no student got
        the right answer. Similarly B does not entail A because there are
        contexts in which its true some students got the right answer while the
        whole class got the right answer. It could be argued that the two
        sentences implicate each other. Imagine a professor trying to explain
        how hard a test will be. Therefore this question would fall into none of
        the above.
      \item B entails and presupposes A as A is just a rewording of the first
        clause of sentence B.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item $\card{\brackets{NP} \cap \brackets{VP}} \ge m \cdot
        \card{\brackets{NP}}$ \\
        Where m is a percentage of ``mostness''. It would be very hard to find a
        universal percentage for ``mostness''. This definition and any other
        definition wouldn't be able to precisely pin down what humans mean by most.
      \item $\card{\brackets{NP} \cap \brackets{VP}} \le 12$
      \item $\brackets{NP} \subseteq \brackets{VP} \wedge \card{\brackets{NP}} = 2$
      \item $\card{\brackets{NP} \cap \brackets{VP}} > m$ \\
        Where m is a number representing counting how many items humans consider
        ``many'' to be. This definiton suffers from the same problem as the
        first definiton.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    $\text{NP}' = \brackets{Somali students} \subseteq \brackets{students}$ \\
    ``Exactly two Somali students are vegan'' does not entail ``Exactly two
    students are vegan'' because there could be non Somali students who are
    vegans. Similarly ``Exactly two students are vegan'' does not entail
    ``Exactly two Somali students are vegan'' because the first two students
    could not be Somali. This means that the quantifier ``Exactly two'' is not
    increasing or decreasing with respect to the NP.

    $\text{VP}' = \brackets{religous vegans} \subseteq \brackets{vegans}$ \\
    For a similar reason as above the quantifier ``Exactly two'' is not
    increasing or decreasing with respect to the VP.
\end{enumerate}
