\title{A Tropical Mindset}

\maketitle

\noindent
In this presentation I will introduce the tropical semiring
$(\mathbb{R},\oplus=\text{min},\otimes=+,\infty,0)$.
\cite{mohri,speyer}
After this I will work through some examples and demonstrate some
properties they posses such as idempotentency and the ``freshmen dream''
$(x \oplus y)^2 = x^2 \oplus y^2$. Then I will show how to reinterpret a
homework problem tropically:
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{k=1}^np(i,k,\ell - 1)p(k,j,1) \simeq \bigoplus_{k=1}^{n} p(i,k,\ell - 1)\otimes p(k,j,1)
\end{equation*}

\noindent
This equation can be thought of as the recurrance to find the length of the shortest path.
The recurrance generates a dynamic programming solution to the all pairs shortest path problem.
This solution also happens to be matrix multiplication under the tropical
semiring. \cite{mohri,antimatroid}
If time permits I will demonstrate how to improve the algorithm's complexity
from $O(V^4)$ to $O(V^3\text{lg}(V))$ via repeated squaring. \\

\noindent
My backup topic is absorbing markov chains. I would cover the drunkards walk.
