Back is a preposition as you can add right in front of it. The sentence ``After
the game, the children went right back into the house.'' is grammatical.
By the coordination test the substring ``went back into the house'' is a verb
phrase. This can be seen in the example sentence: ``After the game the children
went back into the house and slept''.
The substring ``into the house'' is a prepositional phrase as it can be replaced
by ``there''. The sentence ``After the game, the children went back
there'' is grammatical.
By a similar argument the substring ``back into the house'' is a prepositional
phrase as the sentence ``After the game the children went there'' is grammatical.
We haven't learned movement yet so I'm pretty sure I got it wrong but I wanted
to give it a try.

\section{Structural Ambiguity and Constituency}
Tree A: Wanda used a telescope to spy on the lemur. \\

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, transform shape]
  \tikzset{every tree node/.style={align=center,anchor=north}}
  \Tree [.S NP\\Wanda
            [.VP [.VP V\\spied

                           ]
                      ]
                 ]
                 [.PP P\\with
                      [.NP DP\\the N\\telescope ]
                 ]
            ]
        ]
\end{tikzpicture}

Tree B: Wanda spied on a lemur that has a telescope. \\

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, transform shape]
  \tikzset{every tree node/.style={align=center,anchor=north}}
  \Tree [.S NP\\Wanda
            [.VP V\\spied
                 [.PP P\\on 
                      [.NP DP\\the
                           [.N' N\\lemur
                                [.PP P\\with
                                     [.NP DP\\the N\\telescope ]
                                ]
                           ]
                      ]
                 ]
            ]
        ]
\end{tikzpicture}

If you apply ``do so'' replacement to the inner VP in Tree A you get ``Wanda
did so with the telescope.'' If the lemur had the telescope what would Wanda
be doing? The top most PP can be fronted in Tree A to make it clear that Wanda
is using the Telescope: ``With the telescope Wanda spied on the lemur''.
The top most PP can be fronted in Tree B to make it clear that the
lemur has the telescope: ``On the lemur with the telescope Wanda spied''. You
can replace the main NP with a pronoun in Tree B: ``Wanda spied on it''. In this
sentence the lemur has to have the telescope because Wanda isn't using it to spy.
